The assumption is that the layout of the Venue is fixed, so the level information has been taken to be constant and there present in Constant files
Some other ways by which this functionality can be achieved:
1. Expose each of these services as a REST API using Spring and return a json response from the API
2. Manage the database connections using connection pools
3. Integrate the database layer in spring using Hibernate Template
4. The design can further be elaborated to store the confirmation number and the reserved seats specific to each customer, also including the total price for the tickets
(Currently this has not been implemented)
5. The scope of this application is to provide the functionality of the three methods in 
the Ticket Service interface
6. The seatsLeft attribute in the currentstatus table, can be populated from the master table-venue. This has not been implemented in this application
7. Log4j has been integrated to display the loggers
The primary data source to maintain the status of the seats is MYSQL Database. The scripts related to the tables and the database information has been documented in the 
mysql.scripts file
The connection details along with the credentials for this test database is present in WalmartConstants.java
